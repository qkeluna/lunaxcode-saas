## üö® Troubleshooting

### If the button is still redirecting to onboarding:

1. **Restart the dev server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac)
   - Or use Hard Refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or open in Incognito/Private mode

3. **Verify the button text:**
   - The primary CTA button should now say "Request Custom Quote"
   - It should be the WHITE button with purple text
   - The "View Pricing" button is now the second button (outlined)

4. **Check browser console for errors:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors in Console tab
   - Common issues: module not found, import errors

5. **Verify the ContactCTA component is loaded:**
   - The component is now a 'use client' component (required for state management)
   - Check that no parent component is intercepting clicks

### If emails are not sending:

1. **Verify RESEND_API_KEY in `.env.local`:**
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_8iqWbrVs_4pEURSPpuWuGxnuFcnkN8C1w
   ```

2. **Check API route logs:**
   - Look at terminal where dev server is running
   - API route at `/api/contact` will log success/errors

3. **Test the API endpoint directly:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/contact \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "fullName": "Test User",
       "companyName": "Test Company",
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "message": "This is a test message"
     }'
   ```

## üìß Email Template

The email sent includes:
- Beautiful gradient header with "New Quote Request" title
- All form fields in styled boxes
- Clickable email and phone number links
- Philippine timestamp
- Professional footer with branding

## üé® Button Layout

After implementation, the CTA section has 3 buttons:

1. **"Request Custom Quote"** (White, primary CTA) ‚Üí Opens contact modal
2. **"View Pricing"** (Outlined) ‚Üí Scrolls to #pricing section
3. **"Chat on WhatsApp"** (Outlined with icon) ‚Üí Opens WhatsApp

## üîÑ Next Steps

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Share the exact error message from browser console
2. Let me know which button is being clicked (screenshot helps)
3. Confirm that you've restarted the dev server
4. Check if the modal appears at all (even briefly)
5. Verify network tab shows POST request to `/api/contact` when submitting
