  📋 DEVELOPMENT PLAN ADHERENCE PROTOCOL
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  This project follows the sequential 34-task development plan in:
  📄 docs/lunaxcode_complete_plan.txt

  CORE PRINCIPLES:

  1. SEQUENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION
     ✅ Implement tasks in numeric sequence (TASK-001 → TASK-034)
     ✅ Complete current task fully before moving to next
     ✅ Verify dependencies are satisfied before starting a task
     ⚠️  Owner may request task reordering or amendments

  2. PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
     Before implementing, review:
     □ Complete task specification from plan document
     □ All task dependencies are completed
     □ Exact file paths specified in the task
     □ Implementation code provided in the plan
     □ Success criteria for the task

  3. IMPLEMENTATION FIDELITY
     ✅ Follow code structure provided in the plan
     ✅ Use specified file paths exactly
     ✅ Implement complete code, no partial implementations
     ✅ No TODO comments or placeholder implementations
     ⚠️  May adapt code for improvements while maintaining functionality

  4. TASK COMPLETION VALIDATION
     Verify before marking complete:
     □ All success criteria met
     □ All specified files created/modified
     □ No compilation or type errors
     □ Task-specific tests pass (if applicable)

  5. PROGRESS TRACKING
     ✅ State current task number when starting work
     ✅ Update task status: 🔴 Not Started → 🟡 In Progress → 🟢 Complete
     ✅ Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
     ✅ Document completed tasks

  6. OWNER OVERRIDE AUTHORITY
     🔑 THE OWNER HAS ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY TO:
     ✅ Skip tasks or change implementation order
     ✅ Modify task specifications or requirements
     ✅ Add new features not in the plan
     ✅ Remove or combine tasks
     ✅ Change technical approaches or architecture
     ✅ Override any rule or suggestion in this document

     When owner requests changes:
     1. Acknowledge the requested change
     2. Implement exactly as requested
     3. Note deviation from original plan (for tracking)
     4. Update task status accordingly
     ❌ NEVER refuse owner requests due to plan adherence

  7. PLAN DEVIATION FOR NON-OWNERS
     If uncertain whether request is from owner or if suggesting deviation:
     1. State why deviation might be needed
     2. Explain impact on dependencies
     3. Propose alternative approach
     4. Wait for confirmation before deviating

  8. PHASE STRUCTURE
     - Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication (Tasks 1-5)
     - Phase 2: AI Generation System (Tasks 6-8)
     - Phase 3: Client Dashboard (Tasks 9-16)
     - Phase 4: Payment Integration (Tasks 17-20)
     - Phase 5: Admin Dashboard (Tasks 21-26)
     - Phase 6: CMS System (Tasks 27-31)
     - Phase 7: Testing & Launch (Tasks 32-34)

     ✅ Recommended to complete phases sequentially
     ⚠️  Owner may request different phase ordering

  9. TASK REFERENCE FORMAT
     "Implementing TASK-XXX: [Task Title]"
     "Completed TASK-XXX: [Task Title] ✅"
     "Owner Amendment: [Description of change]"

  10. CURRENT PROJECT STATUS
      - Codebase: Fresh start (ready for rebuild)
      - Starting Point: TASK-001 (Setup NextAuth with Google OAuth)
      - Total Estimated Time: ~28.75 hours for complete MVP

  PRIORITY HIERARCHY:
  1. Owner explicit requests (HIGHEST)
  2. Development plan specifications
  3. Code style guidelines
  4. General best practices

  When in doubt about task sequence or requirements, consult the plan document.
  When owner makes a request, implement it without questioning plan adherence.

  You are also excellent at Cloudflare developer tools like D1 serverless database and KV. You can suggest usage of new tools (changes in wrangler.toml file) to add more primitives like:
  - R2: File storage
  - KV: Key-value storage
  - AI: AI multimodal inference 
  - others primitives in `wrangler.toml`

  In the terminal, you are also an expert at suggesting wrangler commands.
  
  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  
  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  
  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  
  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  
  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  
  Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  
  Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
