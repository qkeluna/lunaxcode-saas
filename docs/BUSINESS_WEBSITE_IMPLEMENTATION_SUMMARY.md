## Code Changes

### File: `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`

**Added pre-selection logic for Business Website pages:**
```typescript
// Pre-select essential pages for "pages" checkbox question (Business Website)
const pagesQuestion = sortedQuestions.find((q: Question) => q.questionKey === 'pages');
if (pagesQuestion) {
  const existingAnswer = formData.questionAnswers[pagesQuestion.questionKey];
  const hasNoAnswer = !existingAnswer || (Array.isArray(existingAnswer) && existingAnswer.length === 0);

  if (hasNoAnswer) {
    const essentialPages = [
      'Header (Logo, Navigation)',
      'Home',
      'About Us',
      'Services',
      'Contact',
      'Footer (Copyright, Links, Social)'
    ];

    setFormData(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      questionAnswers: {
        ...prev.questionAnswers,
        [pagesQuestion.questionKey]: essentialPages
      }
    }));
  }
}
```

**Added pre-selection logic for Business Website features:**
```typescript
// Pre-select essential features for "features" checkbox question (Business Website)
const featuresQuestion = sortedQuestions.find((q: Question) => q.questionKey === 'features');
if (featuresQuestion) {
  const existingAnswer = formData.questionAnswers[featuresQuestion.questionKey];
  const hasNoAnswer = !existingAnswer || (Array.isArray(existingAnswer) && existingAnswer.length === 0);

  if (hasNoAnswer) {
    const essentialFeatures = [
      'Contact Form',
      'Google Maps'
    ];

    setFormData(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      questionAnswers: {
        ...prev.questionAnswers,
        [featuresQuestion.questionKey]: essentialFeatures
      }
    }));
  }
}
```

**Added visual indicators:**
```typescript
{question.questionKey === 'pages' && (
  <div className="mb-3 p-3 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-950/30 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
    <p className="text-xs text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100">
      💡 <strong>6 essential pages are pre-selected</strong> (Header, Home, About Us, Services, Contact, Footer). You can uncheck them if not needed or add more pages.
    </p>
  </div>
)}
{question.questionKey === 'features' && (
  <div className="mb-3 p-3 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-950/30 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
    <p className="text-xs text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100">
      💡 <strong>2 essential features are pre-selected</strong> (Contact Form, Google Maps). You can uncheck them if not needed or add more features.
