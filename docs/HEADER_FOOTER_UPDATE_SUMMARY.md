**Updated pre-selection array:**
```typescript
const mustHaveSections = [
  'Header (Logo, Navigation)',    // NEW
  'Hero Section',
  'Features/Benefits',
  'Contact Form',
  'Footer (Copyright, Links)'     // NEW
];
```

**Updated help text:**

## Why Header & Footer?

### Header (Logo, Navigation)
- ✅ **Industry standard** - Every professional website has a header
- ✅ **Branding** - Logo and company identity
- ✅ **Navigation** - Links to sections/pages
- ✅ **CTA Button** - Primary call-to-action

### Footer (Copyright, Links)
- ✅ **Industry standard** - Every professional website has a footer
- ✅ **Legal compliance** - Copyright, privacy policy, terms
- ✅ **Trust signals** - Professional appearance
- ✅ **Secondary navigation** - Social media, contact info, sitemap

Without these, the landing page feels **incomplete and unprofessional**.
