# Pre-Selected Sections Feature - Update

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Feature:** Pre-select essential landing page sections in onboarding

---

## ✅ Implementation Summary

Added automatic pre-selection of must-have sections for the "Which sections would you like to include?" question in the Landing Page onboarding flow.

---

## Pre-Selected Sections

The following 5 sections are automatically checked when users reach the questionnaire:

1. **Header (Logo, Navigation)** - Top navigation bar with branding and menu
2. **Hero Section** - Essential first impression and main value proposition
3. **Features/Benefits** - Core explanation of what the service offers
4. **Contact Form** - Critical for lead capture and conversion
5. **Footer (Copyright, Links)** - Bottom section with legal info and links

---

## User Experience

### Visual Indicator
A blue info box appears above the checkboxes with the message:
> 💡 **5 essential sections are pre-selected** (Header, Hero, Features, Contact Form, Footer). You can uncheck them if not needed or add more sections.

### User Control
- Users can **uncheck** any pre-selected sections if not needed
- Users can **add more** sections by checking additional options
- Pre-selection only happens on initial load (not applied if user has already answered)

## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes

**File:** `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`

#### 1. Auto-Selection Logic (Lines 134-174)
```typescript
// Fetch questions when service is selected
useEffect(() => {
  if (formData.serviceId) {
    const fetchQuestions = async () => {
      // ... fetch questions ...

      // Pre-select essential sections for "required_sections" checkbox question
      const requiredSectionsQuestion = sortedQuestions.find(
        (q: Question) => q.questionKey === 'required_sections'
      );

      if (requiredSectionsQuestion && !formData.questionAnswers[requiredSectionsQuestion.questionKey]) {
        const mustHaveSections = [
          'Hero Section',
          'Features/Benefits',
          'Contact Form'
        ];

        setFormData(prev => ({
          ...prev,
          questionAnswers: {
            ...prev.questionAnswers,
            [requiredSectionsQuestion.questionKey]: mustHaveSections
          }
        }));
      }
    };

    fetchQuestions();
  }
}, [formData.serviceId]);
```

#### 2. Visual Indicator (Lines 431-479)
```typescript
case 'checkbox':
  return (
    <div>
      {question.questionKey === 'required_sections' && (
        <div className="mb-3 p-3 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-950/30 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
          <p className="text-xs text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100">
            💡 <strong>Essential sections are pre-selected.</strong> You can uncheck them if not needed or add more sections.
          </p>
        </div>
      )}
      {/* Checkbox grid ... */}
    </div>
  );
```

## Why These 5 Sections?

### Header (Logo, Navigation) - Must-Have
- **Top of every page** - First thing users see
- **Branding** - Logo and company identity
- **Navigation** - Links to other pages/sections
- **CTA Button** - Primary action (e.g., "Get Started")
- **Industry Standard** - All professional websites have headers

### Hero Section - Must-Have
- **First impression** - Main headline and value proposition
- **Sets the tone** - Visual design and messaging
- **Grabs attention** - Compelling copy and imagery
- **Above the fold** - Visible without scrolling
- **Critical for engagement** - Determines if visitors stay or leave

### Features/Benefits - Must-Have
- **Value proposition** - Explains what the service/product offers
- **Critical for conversion** - Answers "What's in it for me?"
- **Builds interest** - Details that support the hero message
- **Expected by visitors** - Standard on all landing pages

### Contact Form - Must-Have
- **Primary conversion point** - Captures leads and inquiries
- **Essential for business outcomes** - Without it, landing page loses purpose
- **Lead generation** - Collects contact information
- **Call-to-action** - Gives visitors a clear next step

### Footer (Copyright, Links) - Must-Have
- **Bottom of every page** - Completes the page structure
- **Legal information** - Copyright, privacy policy, terms
- **Secondary links** - Social media, contact info, sitemap
- **Trust signals** - Professional appearance and completeness
- **Industry Standard** - All professional websites have footers

### Not Pre-Selected (Optional)
- **Testimonials** - Depends on availability of social proof
- **FAQ** - Only needed for complex offerings
- **About Us** - Depends on brand strategy
- **Pricing/Plans** - Not all landing pages show pricing
- **Gallery/Portfolio** - Depends on visual content availability
- **Trust Indicators** - Nice to have but not critical
- **Video/Demo** - Depends on content availability
